# Gender and age detection

Used model: **Age and Gender Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks By Tal Hassner** (https://talhassner.github.io/home/publication/2015_CVPR).

Used libraries:
  1. *OpenCV* to recognize faces
  2. *PyQt5* to create a GUI
  3. *imutils* to work with webcam
  4. *Matplotlib* to display face recognition in the image

Work algorithm:
  1. Select a method to input an image from the main window

    For finished image

  2. Set a path for input image

  3. Get result for input image

    For webcam

  2. Add a webcam to your PC
  3. Get result for webcam
  
  *P.S. each of these methods has got checking to found face. If programm doesn't found face, it display message.*
